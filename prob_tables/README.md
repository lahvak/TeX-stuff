## Clickable probability tables in TeX

Standard normal distribution tables that can be found in any intro stat
textbook, but clickable.

Compile with pdflatex or lualatex.  When viewed in a pdf viewer that understand
dynamic javascript content, clicking on a z-score in margin of the table
"highlights" the row or column.

I use it for teaching statistics.
